# Delivery Time Prediction System

## Project Objective
This project aims to predict delivery times for orders based on historical data and traffic patterns. By analyzing key features such as distance, traffic level, and order time, the system provides accurate delivery time estimates to improve customer satisfaction and optimize logistics.

---

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and scales features for model training.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes a Random Forest Regressor to predict delivery times.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) for performance evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Provides scatter plots to compare true vs predicted delivery times.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delivery-time-prediction.git
   cd delivery-time-prediction
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Code**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory with the name `delivery_data.csv`.
2. Run the script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
3. Visualize the results using the generated scatter plot.
